## Outline of the course

This pratical chatbot course for beginners covers both types of conversational UI’s, i.e., Chatbot NLP text and speech user interfaces, to reach through multiple devices and platforms. We will take a project-based approach to understand how these UIs are built and the best use cases for deploying them.<br><br>
We will start by building a basic NLP Chatbot with the newly-acquired-by-Google Dialogflow and implement it on your website. At this point, you will have a customized text and voice Chatbot you can use for professional or personal use, ready on your website.<br>
Moving on to an in-depth understanding of the Chatbot, we will explore leak management addressing the questions that were entered by a user and did not find an answer. We will learn how to bring the quality of the chatbot to a higher level.<br><br>
Moving on to Facebook Messenger we will understand the basics of bot integration & see how to integrate Chatbot to social networks. We will explore text and speech UIs capable of interacting with digital personal assistants such as Google Assistant and Google Home. We will then run the applications on PCs and smartphones.<br><br>
Finally, we move on to creating a Task model that can perform complex tasks such as ordering and planning events. We will use the Fulfilment functions of Google Dialog Flow to implement a web service, sending requests and waiting for responses. We will implement ready-to-use machine learning algorithms to enhance the services.<br><br>
By the end of the course, you will be confident enough to create your line of Chatbots and speech UIs on the platforms we have studied. You will also be confident enough to continue your seamless integrations through Dialogflow’s cross-platform functionality on leading platforms such as Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Azure’s framework for Crotona or Skype, and more.<br><br>
You will also have learned how to build a solid text/speech Chatbot standalone website version that you can deploy, update and maintain on several platforms seamlessly. <br><br>
### What is this training about, and why is it important?
This training is aimed at teaching you to improve your processes by creating a fully operational Chatbot through Google Dialogflow that can be deployed on many platforms. You will be able to explore the ground-breaking combination of Chatbot Text/Voice UIs, event scheduling, and Machine Learning. You will be able to use this course to promote yourself through bots on your favorite social networks, enhance your company’s web services and improve the establishing of your personal brand.
 
### What you will learn—and how you can apply it
● Create a Chatbot with a text and voice UI. Deploy it on your website during this course.
● Deploy cross-platform Chatbots along with services including machine learning functions on several social networks and home devices.
● Understand the principles and technical aspects of a successful, professional and personal Chatbot 
● Create a complete NLP Chatbot that can call standard or machine learning services
● Explore personal assistant customized dialogs on Google Homes
● Publish your NLP Chatbot on your Facebook page, Twitter account, Skype and more
 
### This Live Training is for you because…
The course is aimed at developers, consultants, and IT Operations who want to enhance their Chatbot culture through Chatbot technology. If you have been struggling to find the time to gain proficiency and confidence with Chatbot, customized dialogs, and everyday automatized tasks, here is your one-stop solution!
 
### Prerequisites
Artificial Intelligence by Example

Note: For developers familiar with AI, go through chapters 8, 9, 11-17.  For beginners in AI go through the book and programs to get the feel of AI. Focus on chapters 15, 16 and 17. 
However, it is important to understand the underlying concepts of AI to design an efficient text/speech Chatbot.
 
### Preparation
The main preparation is for you to think of how you would like to use a text/speech Chatbot on your website. What theme would you like the bot to learn to help sell or promote your products, services or personal brand? 
 
Write down a few basic questions and answers you would like to start building your bot with. 
You will be implementing this during the live training on your website (you can turn it on and off during testing). Then you will be learning how to deploy it on several key platforms. 
With this in mind, the course will take you where you need to be to finalize your goals right after the course.
 
 
Materials, downloads, or Supplemental Content needed in advance <br/>
·         [Github programs](https://github.com/Denis2054/Hands-on-Chatbots) 

·         (The material will be downloadable in real-time during the course. The size of the packages will remain small enough to that effect.)
